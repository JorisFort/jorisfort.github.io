        <h2>What is it?</h2>
        <p>
          The bot boxer is an interactive boxing machine for your ultimate
          personal workout. It uses high-tech computer vision to track your
          every move. AI sensors predict oncoming punches and calculate the most
          efficient way to dodge your punch. Hidden within the punching bag,
          high-sensitivity sensors read the force, velocity, and direction of
          every punch to give you instant feedback. Every workout session is
          recorded and saved to track your progress. Set goals, track burnt
          calories, and climb up the leaderboard while having fun.

        <h2>What problems does this device solve?</h2>
        <p>
          The bot boxer only solves one problem and that is that you no longer
          need another person to train with. This is handy because there isn't
          always someone that can train with you. For the rest improves the bot
          boxer the training experience by making it more fun, easier to start,
          and better training. This is because the bot boxer has extremely high
          difficulties way better than the best boxer. So you can train against
          better opponents to become even better.

        <h2>How do you use the bot boxer?</h2>
        <p>
          This new technology is really simple, to begin with, you just tap the
          screen and select what you want to do for example fight a zombie, a
          virtual boxer, box to a rhythm, do special workouts, or drill mode.
          After selecting what you want to do you can just start punching the
          bag and the computer will log all the statistics of your training. You
          can then compare this with friends and climb the leaderboards.

        <h2>Who have used this robot / For who is it?</h2>
        <p>
          The bot boxer has been used by multiple famous boxers. For example
          Christina Cruz, Tony Jeffries, and Austen Ford. Anyone can use a bot
          boxer if their gym has one. Or you can buy one but then you will need
          a lot of money. Because the cheapest model of the bot boxer comes in
          at &dollar;29,900. This model doesn't contain extra interactive games
          where you can fight zombies. Because of this, the bot boxer is most
          used in gyms.

        <h2>What can you expect when you get a bot boxer?</h2>
        <p>
          You can expect a fully-fledged box trainer which you can't acquire
          anywhere else at this time. Which will train you and track all your
          progress. All your statistics are also available to view in an app.
          When you order a bot boxer it will be installed and set up in your
          house by professionals. There are also frequent updates with new
          workouts or modes to try out. You also get an extremely durable device
          with a long warranty.

        <h2>What will happen in the future?</h2>
        <p>
          The future of this product is unknown. It is possible that the bot
          boxer becomes more popular and gets used by more famous boxers or
          celebrities. Or that it stays relatively unknown from the public. It
          is also possible that we get to see more and better boxers because of
          this device. Because of the ability to be able to box against better
          and faster opponents. In the end, the device will probably get more
          popular and continue getting sold for the next couple of years.
